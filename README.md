# REACT Airbnb

> Airbnb mock built with React.js and Redux

## Documentation

In this application, I mock, partially, the highly interactive experience that Airbnb's application offers to its users. The application consumes
Airbnb's official API that the good folks at Airbnb have made unofficially available, or at least have made not unavailable. I mock the public-facing site 
exclusively because I intend to avoid making POST/PULL requests to the API anyways since it is unofficial.
